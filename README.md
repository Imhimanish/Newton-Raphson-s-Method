# Newton-Raphson-s-Method
A type of method to find the root

It is a type of method to find the root of any function if we can assume
the approximate location or coordinate of the root.
The geometric meaning of Newtonâ€™s Raphson method is that a tangent
is drawn at the point [x0, f(x0)] to the curve y = f(x). It cuts the x-axis
at x1, which will be a better approximation of the root. Now, drawing
another tangent at [x1, f(x1)], which cuts the x-axis at x2, which is a
still better approximation and the process can be continued till the
desired accuracy is achieved.
